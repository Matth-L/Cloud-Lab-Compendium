# Cloud Systems Projects 🌐

## 📊 Overview

This repository showcases various projects completed as part of my cloud systems architecture and design course. 
Each project demonstrates different aspects of cloud computing and containerization.
Python was chosen not for its performance, but because the primary goal of the course was to learn containerization, rather than getting sidetracked by language-specific complexities.
