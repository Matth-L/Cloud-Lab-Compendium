# Simple HTTP communication

In this question, we were asked to implement a communication between a client and a server using sockets in python.

The server is in the 'server.py' file and the client is in the 'client.py' file.

To run the server, run the following command in the terminal:
```python
python3 server.py
```
The server will be running on the port 8080, it will be available at the address 'http://localhost:8080/'.

To run the client, run the following command in the terminal:
```python
python3 client.py
```

The client will fetch data from the server and from 2 other websites to prove that it is working.
