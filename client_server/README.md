# 🌐 Simple HTTP Communication

In this question, we were asked to implement communication between a client and a server using **sockets** in Python.  

- 🖥️ The server implementation is in the `server.py` file.  
- 📡 The client implementation is in the `client.py` file.  

To run the server, use the following command in the terminal:  
```bash
python3 server.py
```
The server will run on port **8080** and will be available at the address:  
`http://localhost:8080/`

To run the client, use the following command in the terminal:  
```bash
python3 client.py
```
The client will fetch data from the server and from **two other websites** to demonstrate that it is functioning correctly.
